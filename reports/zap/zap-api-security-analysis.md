# ZAP API Security Analysis

Status: DRAFT

## 1. Methodology
- How API endpoints were tested (OpenAPI + manual + automated)

## 2. Endpoints Tested
- List of steps with endpoints
- What was expected vs observed

## 3. Vulnerabilities by Endpoint
For each vulnerable endpoint:
- Endpoint: [method + path]
- Vulnerability: [name]
- Proof: [request/response]
- Risk: [High/Med/Low]
- Remediation: [how to fix]

## 4. Authentication/Authorization Issues
- Token handling
- Privilege escalation possibilities
- Access control misconfigurations

## 5. Input Validation Issues
- SQLi, XSS, XXE, command injection and examples

## 6. Rate Limiting and Resource Exhaustion
- Tests performed
- Findings

## 7. Recommendations
- Quick wins and long-term fixes
